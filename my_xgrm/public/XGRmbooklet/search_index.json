Motivation We are very pleased to introduce a model organism version of our XGR software, which has gained increasing popularity in genomic summary data interpretation since its first release (see Genome Medicine 2016). This version features a newly designed web server, called XGRm, now made available here to all users for free and without any login requirements. It enables almost real-time enrichment and subnetwork analyses for a user-input list of genes or genomic regions, leveraging ontologies, networks, and knowledgebase resources about enhancer-promoter datasets. Besides, the web server is user-friendly, very suitable for users who are unfamiliar with coding. One of the major challenges in genomics research is how to bridge the gap between generated genomic summary data and downstream knowledge discovery. We define genomic summary data as a list of genes (more generally, genomic regions), along with their significance levels (e.g.Â p-values). We are leading the field in making sense of genomic summary data for knowledge discovery through developing approaches and tools that have been verified to be efficient and effective, including XGR (see Genome Medicine 2016), dnet (see Genome Medicine 2014), and Priority index (see Nature Genetics 2019 and Nucleic Acids Research 2022). Building upon our previous approaches that have stood the test of time, and also incorporating the growing knowledgebase of ontologies and networks, XGRm offers four analysers for enrichment and subnetwork analyses, each doing specific interpretations tailored to genomic summary data at the gene and genomic region levels. Analysers GElyser performs gene-centric ontology enrichment analysis; see Example Output RElyser first identifies genes linked from input genomic regions using genomic proximity or enhancer-promoter functional genomic datasets and then conducts ontology enrichment analysis based on the linked genes; see Example Output GSlyser takes as input gene-level summary data to identify a subset of the gene network in a manner that the resulting subnetwork contains a desired number of highly scored and interconnected genes; see Example Output RSlyser first identifies genes linked from input genomic regions using genomic proximity or enhancer-promoter functional genomic datasets, followed by subnetwork analysis based on the linked genes; see Example Output "],["frontpage.html", "Section 2 FRONTPAGE", " Section 2 FRONTPAGE FIGURE 2.1: The landing frontpage of the XGRm web server.
